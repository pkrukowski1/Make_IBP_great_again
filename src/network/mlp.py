class MLP(nn.Module):
    """
    A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implemented as a PyTorch module.
    This class constructs a feedforward neural network with a specified number of layers
    and activation functions. The network is built using `torch.nn.Sequential` for ease
    of use and modularity.
    
    Attributes:
        model (torch.nn.Sequential): The sequential model representing the MLP.
    
    Methods:
        __init__(layers: List[int], activation_fnc: Callable):
            Initializes the MLP with the specified layers and activation function.
        _build(layers: List[int], activation_fnc: Callable) -> nn.Sequential:
            Constructs the sequential model based on the provided layers and activation function.
        forward(x):
            Performs a forward pass through the MLP.
    
    Args:
        layers (List[int]): A list of integers where each element represents the number
            of neurons in the corresponding layer of the MLP. The length of the list
            determines the number of layers in the network.
        activation_fnc (Callable): A callable that returns an activation function to be
            applied after each layer (except the last one).

            first element corresponds to the input size, and the last element 
            corresponds to the output size.
            activation_fnc (Callable): A callable that returns an activation 
            function to be applied between the layers of the MLP, except the 
            last layer.
            model_path (str, optional): Path to a pre-trained model file. If 
            provided, the model weights will be loaded from this file.
