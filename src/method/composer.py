class Composer:
    """
    Composer is a class that facilitates the composition of a neural network module with a list of plugins. 
    Each plugin is expected to implement the `MethodPluginABC` interface and can modify the behavior of the 
    module during the forward pass.
    Attributes:
        module (nn.Module): The neural network module to which plugins are applied.
        plugins (Optional[list[MethodPluginABC]]): A list of plugins that modify the behavior of the module. 
            Defaults to an empty list.
    Methods:
        __init__(module: nn.Module, plugins: Optional[list[MethodPluginABC]] = []):
            Initializes the Composer with a module and an optional list of plugins. 
            Each plugin is associated with the module.
        forward(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> Interval:
            Executes the forward pass through the module and applies each plugin in sequence.
