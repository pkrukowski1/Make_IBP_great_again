## `dataset`

The directory is organized as follows:

- **eran** – Contains dataset utilities and loaders tailored for experiments with ERAN (ETH Robustness Analyzer for Neural Networks).  
- **sdp** – Provides dataset utilities and loaders for experiments involving SDP-based verification methods.  
- **dataset_factory.py** – Factory module for creating and managing datasets across different methods and experiments.  

These modules simplify dataset handling, providing standardized interfaces for loading, processing, and managing data used in robustness verification experiments.
