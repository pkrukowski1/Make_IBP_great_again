## `sdp`

The directory is organized as follows:

- **cifar_sdp.py** – Provides dataset utilities and loaders for CIFAR-10 experiments using SDP-based verification methods.  
- **mnist_sdp.py** – Provides dataset utilities and loaders for MNIST experiments using SDP-based verification methods.  

These modules support dataset handling and preprocessing for SDP-based robustness verification experiments on standard benchmark datasets.
